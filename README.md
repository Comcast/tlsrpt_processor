## TLSRPT Processor

This is a small python script that is meant to be able to process TLSRPT reports (RFC8460).  The script currently only outputs to CSV and key/value pairs.

```
This script should process a TLSRPT JSON file pass as an argument
Options are as follows:
-h                              Show this help message
-i/-input                       Input file
-o/-output-style                Output Style (values: kv,csv)
```

Minimal tesitng so far.  We haven't finished a generator yet, nor received reports from other sites.
